Step 1: Receive Request
: Both registered customers and guests can request an RMA. You can also submit an RMA request from the Admin.

Step 2: RMA Issued
: After considering the request, you can authorize it partially, completely, or cancel the request. If you authorize the return and agree to pay for the return shipment, you can create a shipment order from the Admin with a supported carrier.

Step 3: Merchandise Returned
: The customer follows your shipping instructions and returns the merchandise to you.

Step 4: Receive Merchandise
: You receive and approve the return partially or completely, or you cancel the RMA.
