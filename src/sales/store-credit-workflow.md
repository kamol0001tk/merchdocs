Step 1: Customer Login
: Customer logs into account before beginning the checkout process.

Step 2: Use Store
: Credit During the Review & Payments step of the checkout process, the customer elects to “Use Store Credit” as a payment option. The available balance is shown in parentheses If the available balance is greater than the order grand total, the other payment methods disappear.

Step 3: Credit Applied to Order
: The amount of store credit that is applied to the order appears with the order totals, and is subtracted from the grand total.

Step 4: Customer Balance Adjusted
: The customer’s available balance is adjusted when the order is placed.
