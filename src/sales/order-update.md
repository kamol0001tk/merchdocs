title: Updating an Order
---

When helping a customer who has placed an order, you need to determine the status of the order. The available options for a `Pending` order are different than the options for a `Processing` order. For more information, see [Processing an Order]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}).

## Pending orders

After a customer places an order, but before the payment is received, the order is in `Pending` status. You can edit the order, place it on hold, or cancel it entirely. The button bar of a pending order lists the available actions for an order.

If you modify the substance of an order, the original order is canceled and a new order is generated. You can, however, change the billing or shipping address without generating a new order.

|<span class="btn">Send Email</span>|Sends an email about the pending order to the customer.|
|<span class="btn">Hold</span> / <span class="btn">Unhold</span>|Changes the status of the pending order to _On Hold_. To release the hold, choose `Unhold`.|
|<span class="btn">Invoice</span>|Creates an [invoice]({% link sales/invoice-create.md %}) from the pending order by converting the order to an invoice, and changes the order status to `processing`.|
|<span class="btn">Ship</span>|Creates a [shipment]({% link sales/shipments-create.md %}) record for the order.|
|<span class="btn">Reorder</span>|Creates a new pending order that is a duplicate of the current pending order.|
|<span class="btn">Edit</span>|Opens a pending order in edit mode. The Edit button is only available for pending orders, or for orders based on negotiated [quotes]({% link sales/quotes.md %}).|

## Processing orders

When payment is received and the invoice is generated, the status of the order changes to `Processing`. You cannot change the substance of a `Processing` order, but you can edit the billing and shipping address. A `Processing` order cannot be canceled, but a credit memo can be issued for the full or partial amount of the order, or a return merchandise authorization (RMA) issued for product returns. To learn more, see [Processing an Order]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}).
